# Example, default, layout file
# Each line represents a row of buttons
# Each button is separated by a comma (whitespace between items is ignored)
# The item keywords are matched case-insensitively on the keys from commands in the config file.
# The first match is used. The following line will for instance add the buttons '▶ Play', '⏸ Pause', and '⏹ Stop', in that order:
play,pause,stop
rewind, skip
curl, Explore
# Comments can be added with a # character as the first non-whitespace character of the line
# Extra, empty, rows can also added by leaving the lines empty:
